// ShowStoreOffer is sent by the server to show a Marketplace store offer to a player. It opens a window
// client-side that displays the item.

// a store buttons show up in the in-game pause menu and will, as a result, not be able to open store offers
// on the client side. Sending the packet does therefore not work when using a proxy that is not connected to
// with the domain of one of the partnered servers.
